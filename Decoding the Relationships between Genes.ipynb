    "**Dynamic Programming**\n",
    "The algorithm implements dynamic programming through memoization, where a table is filled in a bottom-up manner, starting from the smallest subproblems and progressing to the larger problem. Dynamic programming can be applied to this problem because it exhibits both the overlapping subproblem property and the optimal substructure property.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overlapping Subproblem Property:**\n",
    "When finding the LCS of two substrings, the same subproblems (smaller sub-sequences) are encountered multiple times. For example, when comparing the substrings \"ABCD\" and \"AED\", the problem of finding the LCS of \"BCD\" and \"ED\" is repeated, indicating that the solution to the problem can be expressed in terms of solutions to similar subproblems. Dynamic programming solves each subproblem only once and stores its solution, as in how `build_lcs_table` function stores the length of LCS to each subproblem. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimal Substructure Property:**\n",
    "For the LCS problem, the optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems. If we have the LCS of two smaller substrings, we can construct the LCS of the larger strings by appending the common element. This is because the LCS of the larger strings is built by combining the LCS of the smaller substrings (prefixes of the original strings).\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed by Cormen et al. (2019), The previous algorithmic strategy is an improved approach to the following strategy (see next code cell) where it eliminates an entire table (b) that store the directions aiding in reconstructing the LCS. Therefore, the algorithm uses the LCS table alone (where the values for LCS all subproblems are stored) to reconstruct the LCS for the original problem. Each `Table[i][j]` entry depends on only three other table entries:`Table[i-1][j-1]` (the element in the north-west direction), `Table[i-1][j]` (the element above), `Table[i][j-1]` (the element to the left). Given the value of Table[i][j], we can determine in `O(1)` time which of these three values was used to compute it without a directions table (b). Thus, we can reconstruct an LCS in O(m+n) time. Eliminating the b tables saves space complexity from `O(m*n)` to `O(min(m, n))` as we aim to keep track of only the current and the previous row or column. This would be especially important when dealing with very large sequences. \t\t\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference in both algorithms also arises in the reconstruction of the LCS, where the previous algorithm returns all LCS while the following strategy generates only one of the LCS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference is in `reconstruct_lcs` function where in the first algorithm it generates the lcs and stores it in a list and then appends other potential lcs to that list. However, for the second algorithm, it only considers one path for the LCS which can miss other paths that also inludes the largest length for LCS. "

    "#### Examining the Matrix and general inference about the tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Before examining the matrix, I aim to discuss 2 assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The parents share the largest similarity to their siblings whether their 1st degree, 2nd degree siblings, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The further down the tree, the further mutations between the siblings and further differences especially between 2nd degree siblings (those sequences that share the same grandparent but not the same parent).\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the first assumption, I can predict the root of the tree representing the original parent to have the maximum average LCS proportion indicating maximim connection to all DNA sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the 2 children of the root node of the tree, I can invistigate the the next 2 highest mean LCS proportions indicating they would be the children nodes of the root node and will be the parent nodes for the remaining strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "By examining the table for each string:\n",
    "\n",
    "I noticed that string b generally has the highest proportions `(0.9, 0.91, 0.83, 0.82, 0.88, 0.83)` with all the other pairs and thus potentially the highest average LCS proportion, making it a great candidate as a root of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then take the two strings with the next highest mean LCS proportion aside from `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both strings `c` and `f` show overall large values:\n",
    "\n",
    "`c` -> (0.92, 0.91, 0.71, 0.876, 0.766, 0.7)\n",
    "\n",
    "`f` -> (0.776, 0.88, 0.766, 0.94, 0.748, 0.897)\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, I can predict those strings to be children of the **root node `b`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parent `b` has two children `c` and `f`**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are no remaining parents in the tree (only 4 leaf nodes left indicating two children for each parent of `c` and `f`), it's plausible to invistigate the LCS proportion for the remaining strings and the parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I shall ignore `b` in this process as it has been already assigned to 2 child nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Taking the two strings with the highest LCS proportion with `c`:\n",
    "\n",
    "(I shall ignore `f` as it's a sibling for `a`)\n",
    "\n",
    "`Strings (c, a) -> 0.92`\n",

    "`Strings (c, e) -> 0.876`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thus, Parent `c` has two children `a` and `e`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2) I can use the same procedure to get the children of `f` or simply take the remaining 2 strings:\n",

    "**The metric**\n",
    "As indicated while inferring the relationships based on the proportions matrix, the process depends on each string's mean longest common subsequence (LCS) containment share. I will use \"LCS proportions\" as a shorthand for this metric.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The algorithmic strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm takes the proportions matrix and the DNA sequences as input. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Execution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The algorithm starts by choosing the tree's root based on the matric of the mean LCS proportion. \n",
    "\n",
    "The mean LCS proportion is calculated by evaluating the average proportion of each string, either by calculating it for each row or for each column, as both dimensions of the matrix correspond to the strings representing the set of 7 DNA sequences. Therefore, I constructed the `lcs_proportion_matrix2` to fill the whole matrix even with redundancies for easier calculation. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) The algorithm assigns the string with the maximum mean LCS proportion as the tree's root. This root is never revisited or reassigned to any other location of the tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) To determine the 2 children of the root node, the same approach is used as both of the children are also parents of the following nodes that will be added, and hence, the algorithm checks the following 2 largest means. \n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates that the algorithm makes a greedy choice, taking the optimal solution at each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) To determine the children for each of those parents, the algorithm considers another metric, \"the LCS proportion\" of that parent and the other strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 2 strings with the maximum LCS proportions indicate that they are children of that parent. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Termination:**\n",
    "\n",
    "5) The algorithm terminates once every string (DNA sequence) is assigned and it returns the binary tree represented such that each string has at least one corresponding string or at most 2 strings indicating a parent-child relationship. Strings with no corresponding strings are leaf nodes of the binary tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The local solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm employs a greedy approach, leveraging the Greedy Choice Property, where at each step, it makes a locally optimal choice by selecting the string with the maximum mean LCS proportion or, later, by choosing the string with the maximum LCS proportion when assigning parent-child relationships in the tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "While making an optimal choice at each step doesn't guarantee a globally optimal solution, the algorithm consistently reaches a locally optimal solution by maximizing the LCS proportion. This ensures that the algorithm makes the best possible decision at each stage, leading to a solution that is near-optimal in the context of the local choices made during the algorithm's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The output structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "The output structure, designed as a binary tree, is well-suited for representing the relationships between DNA sequences after replication. Due to the nature of the problem, there is no requirement to traverse the tree to identify a specific node. Moreover, a binary tree does not impose a clear constraint where the left child is smaller and the right child is larger. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, binary tree allows for a flexible parent-child relationship where each node can have up to two children, providing a structure that aligns with the inherent complexities and variations in DNA sequences after replication.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The data structure used**\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithmic strategy relied on creating 2 priority queues based on a heap, specifically max heap, to find the strings with the highest LCS containment shares efficiently. \n",
    "The heap can be represented as a binary tree where each parent node is less than or equal (in a min-heap) or greater than or equal (in the max-heap) to its child node.\n",
    "The max heap is a suitable data structure in this algorithmic implementation as it maintains the max heap property by heapifying the elements so that the maximum element is at the root of the tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "The heap is used in two ways in this algorithm: \n",
    "1. To find the root of the tree , which is the string with the highest mean LCS proportion. The priority queue based on the max heap finds the strings with the maximum key (mean LCS proportion) in O(1) time, which is faster than scanning through a list in O(n) time.\n",
    "2. To find the two children of each node in the tree by heapifying the unassigned strings based on the LCS proportion. Again, the heap allows us to find these two strings in O(1) time, which is faster than scanning through a list in O (n) time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though there is a cost to heapify the strings in the heap, it's in O(log n) time. \n",
    "Therefore, we can say that the heap will be a better data structure than the list as it allows us to find the maximum element in O (1) time, compared to a list taking O(n) time with a cost that is O(log n) time which is still smaller than O(n) to find an element in the list. This makes the algorithm more efficient, especially when the number of strings is large.\n",

    "   - For each permutation, the `generate_tree` function creates a tree representation with parent-child relationships.\n",
    "   - The function processes each node once, and the time complexity is $(O(m)$) for each permutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Total Complexity for Tree Generation:** $(O(m \\cdot n!)$)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fitness Calculation:**\n",
    "   - The `calculate_tree_fitness` function calculates the fitness of a tree by summing up the LCS-containment shares between each parent and child.\n",
    "   - It iterates over each parent and child in the tree, resulting in a time complexity of $(O(m)$) for each permutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Total Complexity for Fitness Calculation:** $(O(m \\cdot n!)$)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optimal Tree Search:**\n",
    "   - The `find_optimal_tree` function iterates through all permutations and calculates the fitness for each tree.\n",
    "   - The time complexity is dominated by the permutation generation and fitness calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Total Complexity for Optimal Tree Search:** $(O(m \\cdot n!)$)\n",
    "\n",
    "By summing up the complexities: $(O(m \\cdot n!) + (O(n \\cdot n!)) $) it will correspond to $(O(m \\cdot n!)$ since $m$ is extensively larger than $n$. This complexity arises due to the exhaustive search through all possible permutations and the associated tree generation and fitness calculation for each permutation. The algorithm's complexity grows factorially with the number of strings, making it computationally expensive for large input sizes.\n",

    "The provided code implements a dynamic programming approach to calculate the edit distance between two words (DNA sequences) that can be harnessed to calculate probabilities of different operations (Insert, Delete, Substitute, Match) in the context of a genealogy tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dynamic Programming for Edit Distance Calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is an extention to the LCS problem and hence supports dynamic programming as it follows the optimal solution and overlapping substructure property as explained earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overarching goal of this problem is to use dynamic programming to get the least number of operations to get the first input string to match the second input string. To find the least number of operations the dynamic programming table storing the solutions for the subproblems fills the table in a bottom-up manner depending on the path of insersion, deletion and mutation which is a replacement of a character with another character. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:** A 2D array (`dp`) is initialized to store edit distances. The cell `(i, j)` in the array represents the edit distance between the prefixes of `word1` and `word2` up to lengths `i` and `j`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Programming Table Filling:** A nested loop iterates over the lengths of `word1` and `word2`. The edit distance is calculated based on the characters at the corresponding positions in the words. If characters are the same, the value is taken from the diagonal; otherwise, the minimum value from the adjacent cells is selected and incremented by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Backtracking Operations:** After filling the dynamic programming table, a backtracking process is applied to find the specific operations (Insert, Delete, Substitute, Match) that transform one word into the other. The backtracking starts from the bottom-right corner of the table and moves towards the top-left corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking is the main procedure to determine the counts of each operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Probability calculation \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following algorithm, I suggested using the average of the probabilities in each parent-child relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a better approach should depend on bayesian updating to iteratively refine the estimates of probabilities as more data becomes available. We can assign initial probabilities as prior beliefs, and as new data (evidence) is obtained, these beliefs are updated to form posterior probabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prior Beliefs (Initial Probabilities):**\n",
    "   - We assign initial probabilities for each operation (Insertion, Deletion, Mutation) based on prior knowledge or assumptions. (very small values say 0.03)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Observations (Data):**\n",
    "   - Using the dynamic programming, we calculate the counts of each operation for each parent-child relationship based on the DNA sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bayesian Updating:**\n",
    "   - We then update the probabilities using Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayesian updating is as follows:\n",
    "     \\[ P(\\text{Hypothesis} | \\text{Data}) = \\frac{P(\\text{Data} | \\text{Hypothesis}) \\cdot P(\\text{Hypothesis})}{P(\\text{Data})} \\]\n",
    "   - The hypothesis could be the occurrence of a specific operation (Insertion, Deletion, Mutation), and the data is the observed counts of each operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Posterior Probabilities:**\n",
    "   - The updated probabilities after incorporating the new data are the posterior probabilities and can be the final estimate of the probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Iteration:**\n",
    "   - Repeat the process as more data becomes available. Each new set of observations can be used to update the probabilities iteratively.\n"
